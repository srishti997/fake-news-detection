**Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning & NLP**

This project builds a machine learning model that classifies news articles as Fake or Real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Logistic Regression classifier.
It achieves 99% accuracy on the Fake vs Real News dataset.

**Dataset**

Dataset Used: Fake and Real News Dataset (Kaggle)
The dataset contains:

Fake.csv → Fake news articles
True.csv → Real news articles
Both files were merged and labeled:

0 → Fake
1 → Real

**Project Workflow**
1. Data Loading
Loaded Fake.csv and True.csv using pandas.

2. Data Cleaning
Performed essential text preprocessing:
Lowercasing
Removing URLs
Removing numbers
Removing punctuation
Removing extra spaces

3. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF)
Converted cleaned text into numerical vectors using:
TfidfVectorizer
max_features = 5000
ngram_range = (1, 2)
stop_words = "english"

4. Model Training
Used Logistic Regression with:
max_iter = 1000

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Confusion Matrix
Accuracy achieved: ≈ 99%

6. Custom Prediction Function
Created a function predict_news(text) that:
Cleans user input
Applies TF-IDF transformation
Predicts Fake/Real

**Results**
Metric	Fake	Real
Precision	0.99	0.99
Recall	0.99	0.99
F1-Score	0.99	0.99
Overall Accuracy: 99%
Confusion matrix shows very few misclassifications.

**Tech Stack Used**
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Regex
Google Colab

Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
Upload the notebook .ipynb
Upload Fake.csv and True.csv
Run all cells

Option 2: Local Machine 
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
